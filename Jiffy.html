    <h1>Meet the Band: </h1>
    <h2>Jiffwards "Cha Cha Cha" Crossline</h2>
    <h3>Tip-toeing through the mists of ‘ROCK’, this Crossline’s monumental past transcends nothing but myth and musicianship.</h3>

  <p>He’s a chancer – he’s a prancer – by Jove he’s a disco-dancer!
    And this may well be the peak performance from the legend we know as Jiffy Crossline: Cha Cha Cha!</p>
    <p>It all began when he was found out as ‘too good a drummer to get away with it’ as Jiffy describes:
      “I always pissed off the guitar players by being too good, so my first band: The RockDocktors stuck me on the skins.
    </p>
    <p>Well I was good at that too – and that kind of sealed the deal! I progressed to Glam-Rock as a Fish-Head with the fabled Maaad Cod at the helm.
  Now I’m bashing sticks with JSPXL!” Not a word of lie spoken Jiffy. </p>
  <p>This from a man that can tinkle the ivories with aplomb, slap the bass with gusto and pluck the acoustic with virtuosity!
  And the talent doesn’t end there – given the dance floor, Jiffy can slink out a quickstep or foxtrot his toes off all night long!
It goes without saying that his favoured dance is the Cha Cha Cha. As Jiffy says himself:
“Its just as Del La Soul said..... 3 – its the magic number</p>
