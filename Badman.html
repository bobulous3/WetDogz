<h1>Meet the Band: </h1>
<h2>Toby "The Badman" Crossline</h2>
<h3>The Badman’s origins are shrouded in mystery. Some say he walked the earth on a pilgrimage to rock -
  like Caine in Kung-Fu: dispensing wisdom and ‘Metal’ to uninitiated fools. </h3>

<p> Others state his appearance was due to a warp in the space-time continuum, emerging through a trans-dimensional portal (pictured),
  which is by far the more logical explanation. However the Badman arrived on Earth, its fair to say that no-one knows why he is known as the Badman.
  Mystics have been known to pontificate for hours, nay days, casting their runic bones, only to come up with a poor contribution to the evening soup menu.
  Sufice to say, those that knew – knew too much.
<p>What we DO know is when the Badman speaks – we listen,
  and prompted on his tremendous riffage and crunching tone, the Badman sayeth only this: “My sound? Its simple: I engage the power generators on the
  "Incredible Bastard" (his unwordly ampifier)
  and tickle out a ditty on ‘DARK-MATTER’ (his trademark Gibson Les Paul) for the audience's unsuspectig eardrums. It can get messy!"</p>
<p>Nudged for a little more was obviously pushing the Badman to his Bad limits, as he quotes “There aint no fancy-schmancy noodling like any of those Strat-Twats (to mention no names)
  just solid, crunching, shiny metal – you hear me?” Loud and clear Badman – we hear you.
