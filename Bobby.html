    <h1>Meet the Band: </h1>
    <h2>Bobbert "The Noodler" Crossline</h2>
    <h3>Contrary to popular belief, The Noodler earned his name not by scoffing on pots of instant ‘just add water’ happy meals. </h3>

  <p>Instead it was the 6-string antics of a man possessed, in which pissing about on the fret-board in a semi-random fashion was a vague attempt to sound cool.
    He has been quoted as saying on the subject: “The guitar is like a crazy mixed up bowl of chow mien, with plenty of chilli's.
    You gotta know how to pluck out the hot ones and not suck." Wise words indeed, ironically The Noodler sustains that his idols
    such as Hendrix, Sanatana & Clapton would often snarf down a Laksa or hoover up a Pad Thai before a big gig – which only adds weight to the argument.
    Bobby tends to his art with enthusiasm beyond talent – and is usually interrupted by his fellow Crosslines, tired of the 128 bar solo that could go on well into the night
    (or until his fingers fall off!) </p>
