    <h1>Meet the Band: </h1>
    <h2>Lazza "The Disco" Crossline</h2>
    <h3>The Rolling-Rhythm Monster…The Funk Master General…Senior Subsonic….or Move-Over-Rover-Let-Larry-Takeover-on-the-4-String-Bassline-Plucker….., were all names Larry considered before simply becoming: “The Disco”. </h3>

  <p>This dedication for everything funk, soul and brother was quintessential in carving his own chronicles in the tablets of ROCK,
    as Larry grafted with the greats before founding a legend of his own in JSPXL.</p>
<p>Known to have rubbed hair with Brian May, talked tashes with Zappa, smoked Marley under the table, and even mistook Paul Simon for a gremlin (understandable)
   he has commented, “It was an honour shifting cabinets for these guys, man.
   But you gotta remember, these were kids just like you and me trying to crack the big time.
   I was just happy to be around – although sorting through a thousand bags of M&M’s to single out the blue ones did take some time…”
   We are not worthy Lazza – keep on slappin’ those massive basslines dude.</p>
