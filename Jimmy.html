    <h1>Meet the Band: </h1>
    <h2>Jimmmaaay "The Smoothie" Shotpoint</h2>
    <h3>With Moves like Jagger, He’s Hard to Handle, Daddy Cool, and has – The Look.</h3>

  <p>...and all the ladies scream Mamma Mia!</p>
  <p>That’s right – Jimmy’s like Bad Medicine to that Crazy Little Thing Called Lurrve, and with a cheeky smile he quips: I Hate to Say I Told You So.</p>
  <p>Our very own Mr Shotpoint, like a Seven Nation Army, blends everything together like a potent and intoxicating cocktail.</p>
  <p>He’s Dangerous, Bad and Off the Wall, some even say hes Sex On Fire,
  although considering the health and safety implications – it’s just not worth the paperwork.
  So just like those heady whipped up mixes of fruity booze drinks,
  Jimmy “The Smoothie” Shotpoint is back…..I think he even Smells like Teen Spirit?? eiuww</p>
